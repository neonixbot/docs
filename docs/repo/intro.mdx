# Introduction

We are discoverable at GitHub as Independent organization! We are currently have 2 members in our organization. Each member has it's role.
Initially the code is hosted and available in [@gifaldyazkaa](https://github.com/gifaldyazkaa)'s account. But after much thought,
"in order to make it tidier, and make it easier to organize, why not transfer this repository to organization?"
and that's how [@vzetaa](https://github.com/vzetaa) organization can be formed up and being an Independent organization.
