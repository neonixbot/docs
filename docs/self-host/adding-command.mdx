# Adding new Command

If you want to creating new command, of course you can add it into appropriate categories you want.

## Normal Command

Normal command can be executed by putting a prefix before the command name.

To create normal command, Create new file at `src/Commands/CategoryYouWant/`. Copy this template into your new `*.ts` file

```ts title="src/Commands/**/*.ts"
import { Message, MessageEmbed } from "discord.js";
import { Command } from "../../Interfaces";

export const command: Command = {
  name: "test", // Command name
  description: "", // Description of the Command
  aliases: [], // Aliases
  usage: "", // Usage
  testOnly: false, // Is the command limited to your server only?
  permissions: [], // Required perms to run this command
  run: async (client, message, args) => {
    // Your code here
    message.channel.send({ content: "Hello from Koyorin & TypeScript" });
  },
};
```

Then, Test your newly created command with `[prefix]test`. Where prefix is your configured prefix at `.env`

:::tip Tip

Use development server to restart server when any changes made to watched file.

## Slash Command

This is a hotly discussed things at Discord. Now you can make your own slash command you want.

Create new file at `src/Slash/CategoryYouWant/`, then copy this template into your new `*.ts` file.

```ts title="src/Slash/**/*.ts"
import { MessageEmbed } from "discord.js";
import { Slash } from "../../Interfaces";

export const slash: Slash = {
  name: "test", // Command name
  description: "", // Description of the Command
  testOnly: false, // Is the command limited to your server only?
  options: [], // Slash command options
  run: async (client, interaction, args) => {
    // Send a message when slash command is executed
    interaction.followUp({
      content:
        "Hello from Koyorin & TypeScript! This is a slash command. Right?",
    });
  },
};
```

Then, Test your newly created slash command by typing `/test` in Discord chat.

:::info No slash commands detected at the server?

Make sure you have passed `bot` and `application.commands` scopes in [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Then, Invite back your bot using the newly generated link.
